Write a program that reads a certain month from the user (an index between 1 and 12), and findthe data for this month in each year to print out the following information:• Top 3 years and associated values for:– highest maximum temperature (EMXT)– lowest minimum temperature (EMNT)– highest number of days with maximum temperature above 90 (DT90)– highest number of days with maximum temperature below 32 (DX32)– highest total precipitation (TPCP)– lowest total precipitation (TPCP)– highest snow depth (TSNW)– lowest snow depth (TSNW)If there are less than 3 values above zero for a given parameter for that month, then printthat there is not enough data (for example snow depth in August!).• Average of mean temperature across different years (MNTM)– Overall average (average of all years for MNTM)– Average for the first 10 years we have data for (for MNTM)– Average for the last 10 years we have data for (for MNTM)• A histogram of (integer part of) overall average temperatures in 10 year increments (plus thelast remaining years after counting by 10s), print a single star for each degree. Note that thehistogram should disregard missing values.Hint. Just a few hints on how to proceed in solving this homework. It sounds like there are manythings to compute, but it is actually the same thing for many different keys of the same dictionary.My program is 100 lines, it basically has two main functions.The first function loops through through the dictionary for any given month and key (both parametersto my function) and computes all the above statistics, and returns them in a dictionary.Then, in my program, I simply need to print these values. As all the above computation really usesthe same set of value and year pairs, this saves a lot of repetition. In this dictionary, I even returnthe list of values.I have a second function for printing the histogram of a set of values. I can simply use the dictionaryreturned by the first function to find the values, and then use them to print the histogram.This is a good homework to fully make use of generic functions and dictionaries to help you solvemany different problems. Start with one function to print the first line of the output (for EMXT),Expected outputBelow you can see the expected functioning of this program with the file we gave you (note: wemight change the file in the homework submission server):Enter a month (1-12) = 1111Temperatures————————————————–Highest max value = 1975: 83.0, 1982: 81.0, 1956: 80.0Lowest min value = 1958: 10.0, 1996: 10.0, 1957: 12.0Highest days with max = 90 = Not enough dataHighest days with max &lt;= 32 = 1989: 4.0, 2013: 3.0, 2005: 3.0Precipitation————————————————–Highest total = 1972: 6.9, 1969: 6.8, 1959: 6.3Lowest total = 2011: 0.4, 1978: 0.7, 2012: 0.9Highest snow depth = 1971: 22.5, 1972: 19.0, 1985: 11.5Lowest snow depth = 2000: 0.1, 1962: 0.3, 2013: 0.5Average temperatures————————————————–Overall: 41.0First 10 years: 41.4Last 10 years: 41.21956-1965: *****************************************1966-1975: ****************************************1976-1985: *****************************************1986-1995: ****************************************1996-2005: *****************************************2006-2014: *****************************************Enter a month (1-12) = 77Temperatures————————————————–Highest max value = 1995: 101.0, 2010: 99.0, 1988: 99.0Lowest min value = 1963: 45.0, 1960: 46.0, 1961: 46.0Highest days with max = 90 = 1988: 14.0, 2010: 12.0, 1983: 12.0Highest days with max &lt;= 32 = Not enough dataPrecipitation————————————————–Highest total = 1984: 9.4, 2004: 8.7, 2009: 8.4Lowest total = 1964: 1.1, 2002: 1.4, 1977: 1.9Highest snow depth = Not enough dataLowest snow depth = Not enough dataAverage temperatures————————————————–Overall: 73.0First 10 years: 72.0Last 10 years: 73.91957-1966: ************************************************************************1967-1976: *************************************************************************1977-1986: *************************************************************************1987-1996: *************************************************************************1997-2007: ************************************************************************2008-2014: **************************************************************************
